Several REST API endpoints are implemented to query restaurant information and place food orders.
<br/><br/>
To give a sense of real-world problems, production issues are introduced for the developer to investigate using Scientific Debugging methods. Along with this, the developer is expected to improve the app performance under large load scenarios as well as include an advanced search feature in the app.
<br/><br/>
Implemented Using:<br/>Spring Boot, Spring Data, REST API, Jackson, Mockito, JUnit, MongoDB, Scientific Debugging</p>
